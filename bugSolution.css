Several solutions can mitigate the unexpected behavior:

1. **Avoid Mixing Units:** Where possible, try to avoid combining percentage and pixel units within `calc()`. If your layout allows, use only percentages or only pixels.

2. **Use a JavaScript Solution (Less Ideal):** If you absolutely must use mixed units in `calc()`, you could resort to JavaScript to dynamically calculate the width based on the viewport or parent element's size. This is less elegant than a pure CSS solution but offers more control.

3. **Browser-Specific Workarounds:** In some cases, applying browser-specific prefixes or using alternative CSS properties could help. This is not always a guaranteed solution but may be worth investigating if other approaches fail.

4. **Container Sizing:**  Ensure the parent element of the element using `calc()` has explicitly defined dimensions (either in percentages or pixels).  Ambiguous parent dimensions can contribute to calculation errors.  Example of corrected CSS:
```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 80%; /* Define explicit width for the parent container */
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```
